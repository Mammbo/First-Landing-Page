# First-Landing-Page (Destiny Cops)
This is a landing page project for me to learn and cement my skills in html, css with flexbox. Overall, not a difficult project just meant to develop my skills and have fun :) Built this based off some youtube series I used to watch when I was like 7 and playing Destiny, heres the link: https://www.youtube.com/@HuskyRaid
